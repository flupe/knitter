Experiment at making a web tool for designing stitch patterns.
May be rewritten soonish in a serious language once I have a good idea of what
I'm trying to achieve.

> [!NOTE]
> I am a hobbyist that doesn't even own a knitting machine
> (yet), and has a very shallow understanding of knitting techniques.
> This tool is obviously inspired by a very diverse lineage of existing tools for
> hobbyist and professionals.
> It is being developed in public and I'm open for contributions,
> but if you are looking for a reliable and feature-complete tool, that's not it.
> Your best bet is any of the tools in the *references* section of this document.
