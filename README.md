Experiment at making a web tool for designing stitch patterns.
May be rewritten soonish in a serious language once I have a good idea of what
I'm trying to achieve.

## The Plan

- A pretty-good web (indexed-picture mode) pixel art editor for yarn & stitch selection
- A fast and pretty 3d-vis of the design
- A programmatic interface for procedural designs

## Misc

- Possible names when the tool is public:
  - Knitter (maybe some other things exist with this name)
  - Graknit (Gra)
